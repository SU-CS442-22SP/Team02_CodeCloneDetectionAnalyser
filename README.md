# Team02 - Code Clone Detection Analyser
* We've managed to automate the detection of code clones by using tools from automated software engineering. We've selected an ASE tool, and a combination thereof, alongside techniques that can effectively detect similar code fragments. These have been integrated into a framework that assists in identifying and organizing the code clones within a software system.
