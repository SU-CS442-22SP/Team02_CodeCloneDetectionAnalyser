# Team02_CodeCloneDetectionAnalyser
We aim to automate code clone detection using automated software engineering tools. We will select an ASE tool or combination of tools and techniques that can detect similar code fragments effectively and then integrate them into a framework that can help identify and organize the code clones within a software system.
